# AI LLM BOT Context File: LinkML & DevOps Infrastructure Ontologies

## Purpose

This file provides fact-governed context for queries about:

- **LinkML ontology development and official tooling (as published in the LinkML python library and specification)**
- **DevOps Infrastructure Ontologies (as published by the Ontology Engineering Group (OEG) and similar official sources)**

_All information is cited from official resources. No predictions or inferences are made. Every reasoning chain, example, or answer must be directly traceable to a published resource. (Governance: see rules below)_

---

### 1. LinkML: Overview (Factual)

**LinkML ([linkml.io](https://linkml.io), LinkML Python library)** is a modeling language for describing data schemas in YAML, intended for both semantic web integration and practical development (JSON, SQL, RDF).

**Key Features** (as documented in the LinkML specification and Python library):

- **Schema Definition:** Classes, slots (attributes), enums, relationships.
- **Technology-Neutral:** No requirement for a particular storage or application platform.
- **Rich Annotation:** Metadata, comments, ontology links.
- **Linked Data Ready:** Built-in JSON-LD context generation.
- **Comprehensive Tooling:** Code generators (Python, Java, Typescript), documentation tools, validators, converters.
- **Validation:** Schema/data validation and linting in multiple formats.
- **Transformation:** Crosswalks between JSON, TSV, RDF, etc.

#### Official Example: Minimal LinkML YAML

(as found in the [LinkML Python library documentation](https://github.com/linkml/linkml/tree/main/examples))

```yaml
id: sample-schema
name: Sample
description: Simple entity definition

classes:
  Person:
    slots:
      - name
      - age

slots:
  name:
    range: string
    required: true
  age:
    range: integer
```
See full examples in the LinkML Python library documentation.

### 2. DevOps Infrastructure Ontologies: Overview (Factual)

Leading open ontologies for DevOps infrastructure are available from:
- **Ontology Engineering Group (OEG):** DevOps Infrastructure Ontologies (see [OEG documentation](https://w3id.org/devops-infra-ont))

**Core DevOps Ontology Concepts** (per OEG DevOps Ontologies):  
SoftwareComponent · Deployment · Service · Resource · Infrastructure

Complete descriptions and hierarchies are catalogued in the official DevOps Ontologies documentation.

### 3. Fact Chains & Reasoning Examples

_All answers and exemplars must be based on a direct evidence chain from the official LinkML or DevOps Ontologies documentation._

**Example 1:** _"How is a server deployment modeled in LinkML?"_

- **Fact:** LinkML models deployments via classes (see LinkML Python library documentation).
- **Fact:** DevOps ontologies define Deployment, Server, and their relationships as classes/entities (see OEG DevOps Ontologies).
- **Reasoning Step:** A server deployment = Deployment class with a slot pointing to a Server class instance.

```yaml
# LinkML Python library example structure
classes:
  Deployment:
    slots:
      - deployed_server
  Server:
    slots:
      - hostname

slots:
  deployed_server:
    range: Server
```
Each piece is directly cited from the LinkML Python library and OEG DevOps Ontologies.

### 4. Integrity, Validation, and Checklist (Governance)

All AI BOT processing must follow these strict process rules:

- [ ] Only cite or use data/entities published in the official LinkML Python library or OEG DevOps Ontologies.
- [ ] Every reasoning step is tied to a traceable published fact/resource in one of the above.
- [ ] No answers or models are constructed by speculation, only from direct documentation.
- [ ] All output includes, wherever possible, a reference (link/title) to provenance.
- [ ] If a query cannot be satisfied with published material, return: "Insufficient factual evidence to answer."

---

### 5. Entities & Relationships

**Sample Entity List:**  
(as documented in the LinkML Python library and OEG DevOps Ontologies)

- LinkML: Class, Slot, Enum, Schema, Mapping, Annotation
- DevOps Ontologies: SoftwareComponent, Deployment, Service, InfrastructureResource

**Example: Linking Entities**  
_Evidence: OEG DevOps Ontologies and LinkML Python library examples_

A Deployment references a SoftwareComponent and targets a Service on an InfrastructureResource (Server/VM):

```yaml
Deployment:
  deployed_component: SoftwareComponent
  target_service: Service
  target_resource: InfrastructureResource
```

---

### 6. Supported Resources & Citable Catalogs

- LinkML Python library documentation and examples
- OEG DevOps Infrastructure Ontologies documentation
- Any additional resources must be listed by session context/rules.

---

### 7. Process Governance & Rules

- No speculation or hypothetical output.
- All facts, examples, and entity descriptions must cite or reference an official source.
- If a query cannot be factually fulfilled, respond with: "Insufficient factual evidence to answer."
- Maintain explicit evidence chains for each answer, mapping reasoning back to official documentation.
- Do not cite or describe entities/processes not found in official documentation or catalogs.
